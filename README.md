<h1>Values From Text</h1>


This project extract the text corpora from Social Chemistry dataset and aims to explain the moral concernâ€™s polarity, based on the Haidt value, by analysing patterns in texts' RDFs, extended by ValueNet.<br>


First you need to install all the required libraries with the following command:<br>
```console
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

To run the proxy server you need to execute the following command: <br>
```shell
cd src
python app.py -api-owner=[FRED API] <--no-preprocessing> <--no-rdf-downloading> <--no-valuenet> <--no-analysis>
```
<ul>
  <li>-api-owner: specify the API key to access FRED</li>
  <li>--no-preprocessing: avoid preprocessing of Social Chemistry dataset by upload dataframes that are claculated in a previous running instance</li>
  <li>--no-rdf-downloading: avoid the download of RDFs (RDFs already exists) </li>
  <li>--no-valuenet: avoid the communication with ValueNet and load all the previous dataframe obtained in a previous running instance</li>
  <li>--no-analysis: avoid the analysis phase and produce directly the results</li>
</ul>

Note: ValueNet need to be installed locally on a Web Server. For this project it has been placed on a Fuseki web-server
